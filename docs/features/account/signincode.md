# One-Time Access Code

The one-time access code feature is enabled or disabled at the project level. If the feature is enabled, any user registered in our system can request a one-time access code via the email address associated with their account. The code can be sent via email or text, as long as the user has a phone number tied to their account. The one-time access code button can be found on the login screen (image below).
