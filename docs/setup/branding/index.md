# Branding

The Leverege Stack makes customizing the end-user interfaces and emails to your brand very simiple. In this section, we'll cover how you can use the UI builder, our global theming engine, and our email/text templates to ensure that your product is visually stunniing.

## UI Builder

The UI Builder is a stand-alone tool that allows you to edit & update the CSS of all UI elements in real time on your development site. This empowers you to change everything from a button color to the flex direction of a pane, all in one place.

## UI Inspector

In your interfaces, you can turn on the UI inspector, which tells you what variant in the UI builder you are looking at. This allows you to quickly identify and update a given style of a css variant of a UI element.
