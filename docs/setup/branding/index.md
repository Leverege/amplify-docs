# Branding

The Leverege Stack makes customizing the end-user interfaces and emails to your brand very simple. In this section, we'll cover how you can use the UI builder, our global theming engine, and our email/text templates to ensure that your product is visually stunning.

## UI Theme

The UI Builder is a stand-alone tool that allows you to edit & update the CSS theme of all UI elements in real time on your development site. This empowers you to change everything from a button color to the flex direction of a pane, all in one place.

## UI Inspector

In your interfaces, you can turn on the UI inspector, which tells you what variant in the UI builder you are looking at. This allows you to quickly identify and update a given style of a css variant of a UI element. 

## Logos & Branding

It's easy to swap in and out different logos in your UIs using the UI Builder. Read our detailed instructions in the logos section.

## Icons

We provide ample opportunity to customize icons. Customize your map icons, navigation icons, title bar icons, and more. 


## Email & SMS Templates

You don't have to start from scratch with your notifications. We provide 7 email templates and 3 SMS templates out of the box and provide an easy handlebar editor so you can make any customization you'd like. 


## Empty States & Illustrations

When a user is just starting out, it's helpful to guide them through the experience with clear directions and help links. A little illustration here or there never hurt anyone either.
