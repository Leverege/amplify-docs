# Developer Options

Developers have more UI setup options available in the config file for the UI. You can review the complete guide to what developers can [configure here] (https://leverege-steve-molten-docs.web.app/config/).

Some developer configuration options include:

- Configuration: Hiding configuration tools from end-users
- 404 Screen: Changing the copy & illustrations on the 404 screen
- Network Offline Alert: Changing the copy and icon of the network offline alert
- Blueprint Action Icons: Changing the create, bulk create, remove, and edit icons
- User Management: Change different labels & description text within the user management plugin  (ie renaming username to account email)
