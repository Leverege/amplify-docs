# Developer Options

Developers have more UI setup options available in the config file for the UI. Below are just the start to what developers can do with the Leverege Stack. Review our Build documentation for a deeper look.

Some developer configuration options include:

- Configuration: Hiding configuration tools from end-users
- 404 Screen: Changing the copy & illustrations on the 404 screen
- Network Offline Alert: Changing the copy and icon of the network offline alert
- Blueprint Action Icons: Changing the create, bulk create, remove, and edit icons
- User Management: Change different labels & description text within the user management plugin  (ie renaming username to account email)
