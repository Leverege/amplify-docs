# Responsive History Table

A responsive history table is a component that displays historical data on the devices/assets/related blueprints. The component changes its presentation of its data based on the size of the page or panel that it occupies. 

When a user drags the boundaries or resizes the page containing a responsive history table to smaller than a given threshold, the view switches from a history table view to a history list view.

## Accessing the Responsive History Table Configuration

To access the responsive table configuration, click the gear icon in the upper right of the component and select **Edit Settings**.

!!! Tip "History Table/List"
    The responsive history table is called **History Table/List** in the layout controller.

## Configuring the Responsive Table

To configure a responsive table, users must configure both:

* The expanded history table viewer and 

* The collapsed history list viewer

To do so, users edit the configuration when the responsive history table is expanded, and then users collapse the table and edit the configuration when the responsive history table is collapsed. The responsive history table will pull from the same configuration as the “static” versions of the history table viewer and the history list viewer.

!!! Note "History table and history list viewere configuration"
    Please refer to the sections on the history table viewer and the history list viewer for more details on how to configure the components which make up the responsive history table.
