# Layout Controller

The layout controller allows users to configure the layout of UI elements on the page. Users can select from a variety of UI components to occupy different spaces on a page.

## Accessing the Layout Controller

The layout controller is located in the upper right area of the page next to the search bar.

Click the layout controller icon to expand the configuration pop-up.

## Using the Layout Controller

The layout controller divides the page into sections. Each section can hold one UI component.

To select a UI component, click the icon in the section and select the type of component to display from the dropdown list. 

To hide a section entirely, select the No (crossed-out circle) symbol. When a section is hidden, its adjacent sections will expand to fill the gap.

!!! Warning "Certain Components in Each Layout Section"
    Only certain components can be displayed in certain sections. For example, maps and certain table types can only be placed in one of the center sections.

To configure which section expands to the corners of the page, click the directional arrow buttons at the ends of the section. The configuration popup and arrow directions should change appropriately to show which section is now expanding to the ends.

To reset the layout to the persona’s default, click the **Reset** button.

## Saving Layouts to Personas

To save a layout to the page, make the desired chanegs and then click the checkmark next to the dashboard selector. This will save the layout to the currently displayed dashboard. For more information on saving pages to dashboards, see Config Basics.
