# Getting Started with UI Configuration

Leverege Amplify provides users with the ability to configure the look, feel, and behavior of the vast majority of components in the application. Examples of components include tables, maps, rollover cards, and graphs. 

Configuring a page of the application relies on three primary steps:

1. **Configuring each component using its configuration panel**. A configuration panel is a popup or screen where a user can configure and change settings of an individual component on a page

1. **Saving the components to a dashboard**. A dashboard is a single view that arranges and displays all the components on the page

1. **Setting where and for whom the dashboard appears**. By setting the dashboard availability and defaults, a user can specify on which pages and for which types of users the dashboard is seen.

This documentation covers how to configure the UI with various components save configuration to dashboards to be used throughout the application.
