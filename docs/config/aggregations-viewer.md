# Aggregations Viewer

The aggregations viewer is a UI component that allows users to display data based on configurable groupings/aggregations of values. 

The component can be used in a number different ways. For example, the aggregations viewer can be used to:

1. Show the counts of assets by type
1. Show the counts of devices by zone
1. Show the average count of assets in each zone

## Accessing the Aggregations Viewer Configuration

To access the aggregations viewer configuration, verify that the aggregations viewer component is added to the page using the layout controller. Then click the gear icon on the right side of the aggregations viewer panel and select Edit Settings.

## Configuring Aggregations

The aggregations panel is organized by aggregation type. Each of the aggregation types and the configuration options for each are described in the following sections.

### Filters

The filters aggregation allows users to create a count of devices/assets/objects based on a filter that they configure. For example, a user can create an aggregation that shows the number of vehicles that have a `Make = Toyota` and `Year >= 2017`.

To create a filter aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add** button and select Filter
1. Click the **+ Add** button in the first column under Filters. This should create an entry called `Filter 1`.
1. Enter the name of the filter in the field where `Filter 1` is shown. 
1. Click the **+ Add** button in the 2nd column to add a condition. A condition can be a **Comparison**, **Enum Equals**, **Equals**, **Exists**, **Parent Equals**, or **Resource Enum Equals**:
    1. **Comparison** - Compares a field against a known value using a comparison operator (greater than, less than, or between)
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select the type of comparison in the dropdown below the field option (Less Than, Greater Than, etc.) and the desired comparison value in the text box below it
        1. To include empty values in the comparison, check the **Include Empty** box
    1. **Enum Equals** - Checks if a field is equal to one or more enum values. The value should already exist in the data table (be filterable already).
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select the one or more values in the list of values by checking the box
        1. Any of the selected values will be counted in the **Enum Equals** filter
    1. **Equals** - Checks if a field is equal to one or more values. The value should already exist in the data table (be filterable already).
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select the one or more values in the list of values by checking the box
        1. Any of the selected values will be counted in the **Equals** filter
    1. **Exists** - Checks if a field is not empty or empty to include in the count
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select whether the field should be included if the value **Exists** or if the value **Does Not Exist**
    1. **Parent Equals** - Checks if a the parent of a device has attribute is equal to one or more values. The value should already exist in the data table (be filterable already).
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select the one or more values in the list of values by checking the box
        1. Any of the selected values will be counted in the **Parent Equals** filter
    1. **Resource Enum Equals** - Checks if a field is equal to one or more resource enum values. The value should already exist in the data table (be filterable already).
        1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
        1. Select the one or more values in the list of values by checking the box
        1. Any of the selected values will be counted in the **Resource Enum Equals** filter
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Text** view type represents the data as text (or in numerics, a count)
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header** and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right 
    2. The **JSON** view type represents the data as JSON
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes. Save the configuration to the current dashboard by clicking the checkmark next to the dashboard selector.

### Geo Distance

To create a geo distance aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add button** and select **Geo Distance**
1. Enter the name of the aggregation in the **Name** field
1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
1. In the **Origin** section, enter in the **Latitude** and **Longitude** of the point to measure from, the **Unit** of measurement, and the **Distance Type** (plane or arc)
1. Set the ranges of the bins in the **Ranges** section by entering in the min and max values of each range. Add additional bins with the **Add Range** button.
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Text** view type represents the data as text (or in numerics, a count)
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header**, **Sub Header**, and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right
    1. The **JSON** view type represents the data as JSON
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes. Save the configuration to the current dashboard by clicking the checkmark next to the dashboard selector.

### Histogram

The Histogram aggregation groups devices into equal sized bins based on the entire range of data.

To create a histogram aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add** button and select Histogram
1. Enter the name of the aggregation in the **Name** field
1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
1. Set the bin width using the **Interval** field
1. Set the lower and upper bounds of the histogram using the **Min Bounds** and **Max Bounds** fields
1. To set the start of a bin at a given offset, set the **Offset** value
1. To define the bins that missing/empty values take, set the **Missing** field
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Text** view type represents the data as text (or in numerics, a count)
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header** and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right
    1. The **JSON** view type represents the data as JSON
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes. Save the configuration to the current dashboard by clicking the checkmark next to the dashboard selector.

### Range

The Range aggregation groups devices into configurable bins of any size. As opposed to a histogram which uses bins of equal size to continuously span the entire dataset, the range aggregation allows users to specify ranges of any size and do not have to be continuous.Â 

For example, if there exists a dataset that spans from 1 to 20, a histogram may have four bins, each of size 5 to span from 1 to 20 (e.g. 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 ,16-20). A range aggregation can arbitrarily specify any sub-spans of the data which do not have to be continuous or the same size bin (e.g. 5-9, 10-17).

To create a range aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add** button and select **Range**
1. Enter the name of the aggregation in the **Name** field
1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
1. Set the ranges of the bins in the **Ranges** section by entering in the min and max values of each range. Add additional bins with the **Add Range** button.
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Text** view type represents the data as text (or in numerics, a count)
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header**,and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right
    1. The **JSON** view type represents the data as JSON
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes. Save the configuration to the current dashboard by clicking the checkmark next to the dashboard selector.      

### Stats

The Stats aggregation type shows a set of basic statistics of a numeric field. By default, the stats shown are: count of records, minimum value, maximum value, average value, and sum of values.

To create a stats aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add** button and select Stats
1. Enter the name of the aggregation in the **Name** field
1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Stats** view type represents the configuration for each of the stats
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header** and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right
        1. Configure whether each stat is shown or hidden in the aggregation by checking or unchecking the **Show [Stat]** box next to each stat
        1. Configure the label of the stat by setting the **[Stat]** Label field
1. Click **Apply** to apply the changes. Save the configuration to the current dashboard by clicking the checkmark next to the dashboard selector.      

### Terms

The Terms aggregation type shows the count of records by values in a field. For example, the terms aggregation can show the count of vehicles by make, or the count of vehicles by zone name.

To create a terms aggregation, users must configure the **Aggregation** and the **View**:

1. Click the **Aggregations > + Add** button and select **Terms**
1. Enter the name of the aggregation in the **Name** field
1. Select the name of the field in the **Field** dropdown
1. To limit the aggregation to showing first X number of possible values (e.g. if there are 10 total possible vehicle makes, only show the first 4 makes), set the value in the **Size** field
1. Enter any values to explicitly exclude in the aggregation type in the **Exclude** field
1. Enter any values to explicitly include in the aggregation type in the **Include** field. *Note: typically a user would configure only one of the Exclude or Include fields*
1. To only show terms that have a count greater than a certain minimum count threshold, set the **Min Count** field
1. To define the value that terms with empty/no counts take, set the **Missing Value** field
1. Click the **Views** menu and click the **+ Add** button and select the **View Type**
    1. The **Text** view type represents the data as text (or in numerics, a count)
        1. Configure the appearance of the **Header** and **Value** of the aggregation using the configuration opened on the right
    1. The **JSON** view type represents the data as JSON
