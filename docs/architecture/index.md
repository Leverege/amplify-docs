# Introduction

The Leverege IoT Stack is an integrated set of four cloud-native software components that accelerate the development, deployment, and management of enterprise-grade, massive scale IoT applications for a variety of use cases and industries. 

In these guides, we will be covering the no-code project setup & configuration available to our users, along with all of our out-of-the-box features. These capabilities make up Leverege Supervise & Leverege Amplify. For documentation on how to use our stack as a developer, please refer to Architect & Build. 


## Leverege Architect

Leverege Architect provides the foundational tools and APIs to architect your IoT application by creating digital twins that model the real world, defining the system hierarchy, ingesting data from multiple sources, and customizing logic and workflows.


## Leverege Build

Leverege Build provides a set of standardized plug-ins for key features, enables you to custom develop and add plug-ins of your own to extend functionality, and ensures the right look and feel across the entire application with a global theming engine.

## Leverege Supervise

Leverege Supervise equips your internal organization with a centralized administrative view of all your devices, users, and applications to provide enterprise-grade monitoring and device management.

## Leverege Amplify

Leverege Amplify provides end-users with beautifully designed UIs that include the actionable data views your end-users need, and everything can be tailored on a per-role basis using no-code configuration.
