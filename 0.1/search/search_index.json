Let's say you had a tracker in your system. You would create a tracker blueprint, then add all of the attributes (data fields) that tracker needs. For example, you might add a position attribute, a temperature attribute, and a serial number attribute. Before creating your blueprint, let's review the two different types of blueprints our system supports. Types Definition Device This blueprint will be used for IoT hardware. Examples might include a temperature gauge, a GPS tracker, or a more complex device that reports multiple types of information. Group This blueprint will be used for any type object that has a group of data fields. Examples include companies, locations, assets, vehicles, and more. Creating a Blueprint Blueprint Creation Order \u00b6 When adding blueprints to a new project, it is helpful to add them in order of most specific to least specific \u2013 starting with the devices that provide the least context to other devices and ending with those that provide the most. This is because data in our system is roughly hierarchical \u2013 defined in terms of parents and children. By adding the children first, when we add the parent we are able to say that the parent is a parent of this type of thing that already exists in the system. Let's imagine we have the following hierarchy Hierarchy Outline Based on this hierarchy, we need to make 4 blueprints. Based on best practices, we'd want to start with the tracker blueprint and finish with the location blueprint. Tracker Blueprint Cow Blueprint Zone Blueprint Location Blueprint The actual process of creating this blueprint takes a few seconds. But thinking through a tracker\u2019s blueprint structure and setting it up correctly can help make your system easier to maintain, organize, and ultimately scale. Trackers send data in formats that we (typically) have no control over. They may include information our end users don\u2019t care about, or format it in a way that is difficult to use. We need to balance the demands of preserving the data as sent (for auditing and diagnosis), and representing it in a way that makes sense to the users of our system. Sketching the Structure \u00b6 { \"deviceId\" : \"981472630769911\" , \"time\" : 1619291293517 , \"payload\" : \"+STA,981472630769911,28.39,1$\" } Let's use the following example message to start off. The message is coming from the external world. It needs to be read by an ingestor that can translate into a device message that our system can understand. Our ingestor is going to choose how to parse out the information in this message, what bits of it to forward on, and how that data is named. We\u2019re going to use our tracker blueprint to set out how we want the data to be structured once it gets into our system--to dictate how the ingestor should translate this message. We can see that the inbound message to the ingestor gives us a device identifier (an IMEI in this case), the time the message was sent, and the payload. The send time is interesting from a message standpoint, and could be helpful with diagnosing message backups or the like. But it probably isn\u2019t necessary to capture in our device data--it\u2019s data about the message transmission stream, not the device. So we\u2019ll trust our ingestor to log that information somewhere, but won\u2019t include it in the blueprint. We\u2019ll definitely need the IMEI. That\u2019s how the outside world talks about the tracker, so we\u2019ll need to capture that so we can map it to our internal system. The real action is in the payload. It comes as a single piece of data (a string), but is packed with information. Our ingestor can parse this into a friendly format. So we just need to figure out what that format should be. There are two types of payloads, giving us roughly seven different data points: the device ID, which we already have from above, the type of message the device sent, the position information, temperature, light status, door status, and whether the device was in motion. { te mpera ture : nu mber/degF , posi t io n : { la t , lo n }, i n Mo t io n : boolea n , doorOpe n : boolea n , ligh ts : boolea n , imei : s tr i n g } But there are some other pieces of data we probably want to capture. It\u2019s probably a good idea to save the unparsed message string itself. It\u2019s short, so we\u2019re not worried about impact on memory. And it requires some parsing to get the values we want, which we may well screw up (or the vendor may change the interpretation on us), so it\u2019d be good to have a record. It\u2019d also be handy to know when we last updated the device, and (since we get it) when the device last recorded the data. Finally, trackers usually have some easy to read label stamped on the side that helps humans quickly figure out which tracker is which. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019ll get one from the vendor and call that a name. So let\u2019s add some more to our back-of-the-envelop sketch: { las t Msg : s tr i n g , las t Upda te d : t imes ta mp , las t Recorded : t imes ta mp , na me : s tr i n g } Creating the Blueprint \u00b6 Now, it's quite easy to create a blueprint in our system. First, you'll navigate to the blueprints section and click the Create Blueprint button in the top right corner of the screen. Because the tracker is IoT hardware, you'll select the blueprint type Device . Creating a Blueprint Once you've created the blueprint, there are a few information fields to fill in about the blueprint. Field Definition Name Now, the easiest name to use would be tracker, but your system may have more than one type of tracker as it scales. Therefore, you might want to consider using the Tracker's marketing name (ex. Locator). Alias The alias should be short, obvious, and camelCase. We\u2019re going to set up API calls that query and route data using this alias. In this case, we'll use tracker Description Optional field to describe what your tracker in more depth. Here, we might put \"Gen2 Cow Tracker\" Adding Attributes \u00b6 Now that you've set up the blueprint, it's time to add your attributes. As a reminder, attributes are the data fields of a given blueprint. The steps to create an attribute are: Type in the attribute name in the path field input & hit return Select the type off the list (ex. string, temperature, geoposition) Customize any attribute configurations in the panel on the right The value that we type into the add attribute box controls how the data is actually stored in our system (the key in a JSON object). We use camelcase as a matter of convention. The value you type here may not, however, be friendly to read on a UI. If you want to change the display name of the attribute, you can enter the display name in the configuration panel on the right. As an example, let's say your attribute path is fishEaten . A display name for this might be Total Number of Fish Eaten . < VIDEO >","title":"Blueprints"},{"location":"architecture/blueprint/#blueprints","text":"Blueprints define the structure of our data and relationship between data entities in our solution.

Let's take a look at our hierarchy again to form a plan. Hierarchy Outline Our IoT stack supports 4 types of relationships. Note that the parent should always come first in the relationship.

One-to-many relationships are commonly used for locations, companies, regions, etc and their children.

All of these can be accessed and manipulated using the API library and/or in Architect's UI. Project \u00b6 Projects are the top-level organization layer in our stack. They hold most other objects and data related to your solution, such as blueprints, systems, message routes, and scripts. A project has have project-specific users (accounts), that are used to assign access to systems and devices. Blueprint \u00b6 A Blueprint is used to define both IoT device data, and organizational data and relationships. Blueprints can have an alias that is useful when accessing data via the Model Interface API. The alias defines a human readable unique name for the model. Each Blueprint has a set of attributes. Messages for a Device can be routed based on its Blueprint type, allowing different handling of different data types. Attribute \u00b6 An Attribute defines a field in a Blueprint. There are several types of Attributes such as string, numbers, units, timestamps and relationships. The Attributes can be used to dynamically interpret data in a Device. Device \u00b6 A Device represents a thing, either an IoT device or an organizational construct. Each Device has a Blueprint that defines what kind of thing it is. Internally, a Device has an platform generated id. The Device can have multiple source specific ids as well. It is captured through the concept of a network alias. The network alias consists of a Network Id, a alias key, and a value. An example of this triplet might be ('boat-network', 'esn', '5551212' ). This triplet allows the platform to map the external id to the internal id. Project Users can also be assigned permissions on a Device. System \u00b6 A System holds a collection of Devices. Project Users can be given access rights to a System, allowing different users to access different collections of Devices. Network \u00b6 A Network represents a source of device data. When a device needs to be contacted, the Network is used as the target. In particular, messages are published to the -outbound topic. The ingestion service setup to manage that network's data can listen on this topic and then communicate appropriately to the source server. The Network Id is also part external identity of a Device. Message Route \u00b6 A Message Route defines how a particular Message type ( deviceDataEventMsg for example ) is acted upon. This is used to select which reason scripts will run when a new data for a Device is received. Reason Script \u00b6 A Reason Script is code that can be run in response to new Message or a Timer. These Scripts are used to supply business logic to your project. Actions like Sending out a daily status email or calculating alert states and sending notifications when they occur would fall under the domain of a Reason Script. These Scripts can also interface with external systems, as needed. Reason Trigger \u00b6 The Reason Triggers are like Scripts, but without having to write code. For many simple tasks such as sending alerts when a device is in a certain state for a certain amount of time, triggers will be easier to setup than a Script. Timer \u00b6 A Timer represents a task that needs to be trigger in a certain amount of time, or repeatedly. These are often used to tell a Reason Script to run periodically. Template \u00b6 Templates are used to create branded emails or SMS notifications. When Reason triggers a send email request, a Template Id and contextual data can be supplied to produce the branded email. Scenario \u00b6 A Scenario defines how data values for a particular Blueprint change over time. It uses a key framing system to allow the user to set values at given points in time. The intermediate values are computed by a function that exists between two key frame values. A Scenario can be played on a Simulated device. Users \u00b6 There are two types of users in the Leverege Platform: Platform Users are users that can create and edit a Project and all of the supporting pieces such as Blueprints, Networks, Scripts. Project Users are end users of the resulting product. They have access to Systems and Devices. Project User names are unique to a Project, so two different Projects can have a user with name 'demo'. Api Access \u00b6 The Api Access key is used to allow a server to communicate with the Api Server as an admin of the project without having to login. This key is used with the api-service library.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"architecture/core/#introduction","text":"This describes the various objects used in the Leverege IoT Stack.

Inside the Leverege Stack, devices (and many other elements of a project) are assigned a Base62 UUID. Base62 IDs consist of the capital letters A-Z, the lower case letters a-z, and the numbers 0\u20139. It is a binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format. An example of a UUID is 1pTW01YR4mUAEbcHhbXHk8 . But these IDs are not how devices refer to themselves when sending a message, or how users refer to a device when they need to interact with it. Our example tracker from the cow solution sends an IMEI as its identifier when it reports. A farm hand might pair a tracker to a cow by scanning a QR code or typing an ID from a label printed on the tracker. For this project, let\u2019s assume the cow trackers have a QR code which encodes the serial number of the tracker.

Label Value Definition Name Display Name This is the display name of your network. Device ID deviceId This is the identifier of the given device ID. In our example of the cow tracker, the tracker's identifier is a serial number. Identifiers aliasKey This describes what type of identifier the given device ID is. It refers to a identifier type that we will enter into our network definition. API Key networkId This is used as the networkID and tells us which network, from the list of the networks on the given API server, the API should look to find this device. To understand what work these options are doing, let\u2019s take a look at our message docs for inbound messages. Inbound messages include a networkId, an aliasKey, and a deviceId. Note the example below: /** ... * @param { s tr i n g } da ta . net workId The net workId o f t he source * @param { s tr i n g } da ta .deviceId A s tr i n g represe nt i n g t he ex ternal na me o f t he device.

When creating the network, we are defining the networkId and the aliasKeys on that network. The actual deviceId gets created at the device level. Choosing Good Network Values \u00b6 Back to our Architect UI, where we are creating the network, we need to choose the name, API Key ('networkId'), and Identifiers ('aliasKeys'). The name is simply a human readable display name for the network, so that we can pick it out on our list of networks. We are creating the network for our cow trackers, so let's call it Cow GPS Tracker Network. Note that you should not include your environment in your network name (for example, Dev Tracker Network is a bad name). The networkId (entered in the \u2018Api Key\u2019 field) must be unique across all projects in your Architect instance. It should be short, and describe the source / interface. For our example, we'll use \u2018cow-tracker-network\u2019. By convention, networkIds are skewer cased. The aliasKeys are the types of external identifiers. The devices provide us with IMEIs when they send messages, and the users will use the serial number. It\u2019s a good practice to be descriptive and specific with these names (and not just default to \u2018deviceId\u2019, for example). So lets set that field to \u2018imei,serialNumber\u2019. Creating a Network To tie this together, this tells us that a parsed inbound Cow Tracker device message from our ingestor might look something like this: { t ype : 'i n bou n dDa ta Eve nt Msg' , t ime : 1619388341985 , net workId : 'cow - tra cker - net work' , aliasKey : 'imei' , deviceId : ' 981472630769911 ' , da ta : [ { pa t h : ' te mpera ture ' , value : 30.20 } ], }","title":"Networks"},{"location":"architecture/network/#networks","text":"A Network represents a source of device data. When a device needs to be contacted, the Network is used as the target. In particular, messages are published to the -outbound topic. The ingestion service setup to manage that network's data can listen on this topic and then communicate appropriately to the source server. The Network ID is also part external identity of a Device. Inside the Leverege Stack, devices (and many other elements of a project) are assigned a Base62 UUID. Base62 IDs consist of the capital letters A-Z, the lower case letters a-z, and the numbers 0\u20139. It is a binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format. An example of a UUID is 1pTW01YR4mUAEbcHhbXHk8 . But these IDs are not how devices refer to themselves when sending a message, or how users refer to a device when they need to interact with it. Our example tracker from the cow solution sends an IMEI as its identifier when it reports. A farm hand might pair a tracker to a cow by scanning a QR code or typing an ID from a label printed on the tracker. For this project, let\u2019s assume the cow trackers have a QR code which encodes the serial number of the tracker. Networks let us define how our internal devices will be mapped onto the the source, and set up messaging topics that allow communication with the device using these external names.","title":"Networks"},{"location":"architecture/network/#creating-a-network","text":"Creating a Network In your Architect project, click the Networks tab on the left side, and click the Add Custom button in the top right corner.

Role-based access control refers to the idea of assigning permissions to users based on their role within an organization. It offers a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less prone to error than assigning permissions to users individually. When using RBAC, you analyze the needs of your users and group them into roles based on common responsibilities. You then assign one or more roles to each user and one or more permissions to each role. The user-role and role-permissions relationships make it simple to perform user assignments since users no longer need to be managed individually, but instead have privileges that conform to the permissions assigned to their role(s). For example, if you were using RBAC to control access for a cow tracking application, you could give the farm manager a role that allows them create locations, add & manage users, and view employee performance analytics. Farm hands may have a role that only shows them the cows at a given location and any alerts associated with that location. When planning your access control strategy, it's best practice to assign users the fewest number of permissions that allow them to get their work done. This is called the Principle of Least Privilege. Roles & Permissions UI Terminology \u00b6 Field Definition Permission Defines a single action that can be done (create, read, update, delete, list) Role A group of permissions that indicate what a user with this role can do.

Using roles makes it easier to add, remove, and adjust permissions than assigning permissions to users individually. As your user base increases in scale and complexity, roles become particularly useful. You can also use roles to collect permissions defined for various APIs.

Systems use only the common CRUDL permissions. Device Devices are digital shadows of physical objects. They can represent hardware devices like trackers, physical assets like cows, or organizational buckets like companies. Blueprint Blueprints define the structure of our devices and relationship between device entities in our solution. Some permissions are generated when Blueprints or relationship Attributes are made. Common Permissions \u00b6 Some permissions can be seen used against nearly every type of object in the platform. These are the CRUDL permissions. CRUDL is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, List. Create - the permission to create an object Read - given some object\u2019s id, the ability to read its data Update - given some object\u2019s id, the ability to update its data Delete - given some object\u2019s id, the ability to delete it List - the ability to get a list of all objects without having to know their ids Permission Categories \u00b6 When adding permissions to roles, you'll see that there are 3 different categories of permissions. Category Definition Custom Custom refers to custom permissions built for custom actions or access in your project Project Project permissions are permissions that are autogenerated for your blueprints, relationships, etc. They are project-specific and relate to your data architecture. Imagine Imagine permissions are permissions relating to modules and features that are the same across projects. An example of this is user management permissions. System Permissions \u00b6 Systems are buckets of devices that can be used to logically separate sets of devices from each other. Systems use only the common CRUDL permissions. Device \u00b6 Devices are digital shadows of physical objects. They can represent hardware devices like trackers, physical assets like cows, or organizational buckets like companies. Devices use the common CRUDL permissions, but also have the following custom permissions: readData - Read not only a device\u2019s header information (like a name), but also its data, which might include things like sensor readings, addresses, or contact information. readHistory - View the changes to a device\u2019s data over time readEvents - View the relevant events that have occurred to a device over time. Might include things like threshold violations or alerts. updateEvents - Update or create device events sendMessage - Send a device a message. This may only be relevant if a device is physically capable of receiving messages, like in the instance of configuring a tracker or other piece of hardware. runSimulation - Simulate a device readByNetworkAlias - Get devices by their network ids deleteRelationship - Delete a device's relationship. For instance, removing a cow from a barn stall, or unpairing a car and a tracker. Deleting a relationship will not delete the device. createRelationship - Create a device\u2019s relationships. For instance, pairing a car and tracker. Creating a relationship does not create a device. updateData - Update a device\u2019s data. This generates historical data points, and will be reflected to anyone with a readData permission. An example of updating a device\u2019s data would be setting a Farm\u2019s address. updateAnyData - A more powerful version of updateData. Users with updateData are restricted to updating fields as validated by the device\u2019s Blueprint. Users with updateAnyData are not subject to that restriction. As an example, a user with updateData likely couldn\u2019t change the temperature reported by a sensor, but a user with updateAnyData could. This permission is usually only for administrators. Blueprints & Relationships \u00b6 Some permissions are generated when Blueprints or relationship Attributes are made. They tend to follow a similar form as the Device permissions. The main difference is that Blueprint or Attribute level permissions only allow a user to perform actions on Devices of a given type, or at certain paths in the hierarchy as defined by the Attributes. Their permissions are as follows: Blueprints: \u00b6 Create : create Devices of a type Read : read Devices of a type (if you know the id) Update : update Devices of a type Delete : delete Devices of a type List : list Devices of a type Read History: read the history of any Devices of a given type Read Events: read the events of any Devices of a given type Update Events: update the events of any Devices of a given type Send Messages: send messages to any Devices of a given type Delete Relationships: delete any relationships that go to Devices of a given type Create Relationships: delete any relationships that go to Devices of a given type Update Data: update the data of any Devices of a given type Update Any Data: update any data (unvalidated) of any Devices of a given type Relationship Attributes \u00b6 Create in a : Create Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Read from a : Read Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy (must know the id) Update in a : Update Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Delete from a : Delete Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy List in a : List Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Read History in a : Read the history of Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Read Events in a : Read the events of Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Update Events in a : Update the events of Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Send Messages in a : Send messages to Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Remove from a : Delete relationships to Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Add to a : Create Relationships to Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Update data in a : Update the data of Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Update Any Data in a : Update any data (unvalidated) of Devices of a given Blueprint at a given place in the hierarchy Example \u00b6 In our farming example, let's imagine we have the following hierarchy. Example of Farm Hierarchy Let's say you want to give your farmhand role the ability to create a cow, but only in a location. Your permission for this would be: Create a cow in a location This permission allows the user to create a cow when they are at the location level cows page. This user would not be able to create a cow on the cows page at a company. Now, you want your farm manager role to be able to create a cow in a location and in a company. They would have two permissions on their role: Create a cow in a location Create a cow in a company Finally, let's say instead of letting the farm manager role create cows in a location or in a company, you want them to be able to create a cow anywhere in the system. For this, you would use the following blueprint-level permission Can create a cow API Access \u00b6 ApiAccess objects represent sets of tokens/keys that allow third party services to connect to the Leverege Platform (usually as project level admins) using OAuth2. ApiAccesses use only the common CRUDL permissions. User Management \u00b6 Users are the users of a give IoT project. Users use the common CRUDL permissions, but also have the following custom permission. assignRoles - allows a user to assign roles to other users. Unless they\u2019re admin, users can only assign roles they already have. For the common CRUDL permissions, when applied to user management, they look like the following. Users CRUDL Permissions \u00b6 Create Delete List Read Update Network \u00b6 Networks represent a collection of mappings from external ids to internal Leverege ids. Networks ensure that only one device at a given time can have a given external mapping. For example, if you are sending tracker data into the Leverege Stack, that data will need some form of identifier to say what device it is from. Many times that id is chosen by the manufacturer, say a serial number or SKU. A network will map that serial number or SKU to a device\u2019s unique id in the Leverege Stack, and ensure that mapping is one-to-one. Networks use only the common CRUDL permissions. Common Permission Needed for Pairing readByNetworkAlias is a common permission that must be added to a role if that role is responsible for pairing one device to another and the network ID is used in the pairing form Configuration \u00b6 By default, any user can perform UI configuration for themselves.

Note that an engineer has the ability to hide configuration on a per-role basis in the config file on the UI.

To do that, we first need to create a system. Systems The Core Concepts doc briefly describes Systems as follows: A System holds a collection of Devices. Project Users can be given access rights to a System, allowing different users to access different collections of Devices. Devices are the digital representations of the real world entities in our project: facilities, zones, trucks, trackers. They are collected in a system in our Imagine project. Systems are one of the places where we introduce permissioning and access control. Systems can be used to silo devices on a project. We could use it to separate a development and production data set, for example. Or we could use it to drive a multi-tenancy solution. If Tusk Trucking wanted to sell the SmartWalrus tracker to other trucking companies, we might set up multiple systems in Tusk\u2019s project that allow a Tusk administrator to add/remove trackers across systems, but ensure that Seal Shipping\u2019s trackers won\u2019t show up in the Parcel Penguin UI. (The Leverege platform allows us to define permissions at a granular level at any point in the device chain, so we could achieve the same result in many different ways. Systems just give a clean, simple division for separating devices that will never need to interact.) Creating a System Go to the System tab on the left, and click + New System. Click the Info tab at the top Give your system a more descriptive name Give your system a short alias The alias is how custom API calls will refer to this collection of devices. Using an alias instead of the system ID (which is also an option) allows us to make minimal changes when deploying a production application off of a staging or development environment. Creating Devices For our Tusk Trucking project, we\u2019re going to focus the pilot at a single facility with three zones. We\u2019ll have three trackers, and three trucks. Create the Facility Let\u2019s start by creating our facility. In your system view, click the Devices tab at the top. Click +New Device. Choose Facility as the type of device. (Don\u2019t click the simulated checkbox. For this project, we are going to be mocking a production environment, and will not be using the simulator built into the Imagine platform.) You\u2019ll see your new Facility Device in the list. Click that row to reveal a device info editor on the right. Here, you\u2019ll see the header data for the device, including the device\u2019s internal UUID, and name. The name here is used to identify the device in the devices list, and as a fallback name if nothing is supplied in the device\u2019s data. We\u2019ll say the name for this facility is Tusk HQ. On the left panel where Tusk HQ is selected: click the slider button (the middle of the three buttons on the right of the row). This will take us to the device\u2019s data page. From here, we can edit data about the device by clicking into any of the fields (Name, Position, StreetAddress), typing a value and hitting return. We can also add zones, trucks, and trackers to this facility. Enter the facility name (Tusk HQ) in the name field. This may seem redundant, but we prefer to put end-user facing information in the data, because (a) it provides a history of changes, and (b) it gives us a consistent place to access all the data we care about when reading info about a device. If you try to change a value, and no changes occur, then you\u2019re probably not running some piece of the platform. Transponder (configured to write to firebase) or message-processor are likely candidates. We\u2019ll skip the other two fields for now (we\u2019ll set those with the UI that we build in 5. Frontend Development with Molten). Instead, let\u2019s add some trackers. Click the + button in the top right of the trackers section Click create new device in the dialog that appears ; We\u2019ve created our first tracker device, and automatically associated it to this facility. Click the \u2192 on your new tracker\u2019s entry on this, the Tusk HQ facility\u2019s device page, to go to the tracker\u2019s device page. Create the Trackers When we click through to the tracker device page device, we\u2019ll land on the data tab. This is the same view we were just on for our facility device. This is the first of three trackers we\u2019ll create, which have the following IMEI identifiers: 981472630769911, 508830987016281, 103900341265889. (These come from the .env of the simulator we will use to feed the system.) Let\u2019s add 981472630769911 to the IMEI field here. Add The Network Information Unlike the facility we created, trackers will need to collect their data from the outside world. In the previous section, we created a network that defined how we can map an external identifier to the internal device: via a network. Now we need to add this device to the network we created: Click the Info tab at the top of the device info screen This screen is another way of editing the device header information (we saw a different editor from the devices list view, where it appeared in the side panel) Give the tracker a name that describes what it is ('Tracker') and an identifier ('981472630769911') From the Network dropdown, select your custom network Choose Yes Notice we now have two new fields we can update: imei, and macAddress. These correspond to the aliasKey fields you entered as comma separated values in the network creation screen. Enter 981472630769911 into the imei field We\u2019ll leave the macAddress blank for now. Click your system name (e.g., Tusk Production) in the breadcrumb at the top to be taken back to your device list. ; Create the Remaining Trackers From our list view, we have a few options to create new trackers. We could go to the Facility device, and add them via the facility\u2019s trackers relationship. Or we could create new tracker items from this list. If we create them on this list, we just have to remember to associate these trackers with our facility afterward. To do that, simply go to the facility\u2019s data page, click the + in the trackers section, and select the already created tracker from the list. Create the Trucks Creating the Trucks is a very similar process to creating trackers. Return to the Tusk HQ device data page where you created the trackers (click the slider button next to Tusk HQ) Click the + button in the top right of the trucks section Click create new device in the dialog that appears Now that the truck is created, let\u2019s give it a less generic name, and pair it with a tracker that will theoretically be installed in the truck. Click the \u2192 on your new truck\u2019s entry to go to the truck\u2019s device page. Click the Info tab at the top of the device info screen, and change the truck name to Tusk Truck 1 Return to the data tab and click the Click to pair device + box at the bottom Select tracker 981472630769911, and voila!

Each of the aggregation types and the configuration options for each are described in the following sections. Filters \u00b6 The filters aggregation allows users to create a count of devices/assets/objects based on a filter that they configure. For example, a user can create an aggregation that shows the number of vehicles that have a Make = Toyota and Year >= 2017 . To create a filter aggregation, users must configure the Aggregation and the View : Click the Aggregations > + Add button and select Filter Click the + Add button in the first column under Filters.

As opposed to a histogram which uses bins of equal size to continuously span the entire dataset, the range aggregation allows users to specify ranges of any size and do not have to be continuous. For example, if there exists a dataset that spans from 1 to 20, a histogram may have four bins, each of size 5 to span from 1 to 20 (e.g. 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 ,16-20). A range aggregation can arbitrarily specify any sub-spans of the data which do not have to be continuous or the same size bin (e.g. 5-9, 10-17).

Examples of components include tables, maps, rollover cards, and graphs. Configuring a page of the application relies on three primary steps: Configuring each component using its configuration panel . A configuration panel is a popup or screen where a user can configure and change settings of an individual component on a page Saving the components to a dashboard . A dashboard is a single view that arranges and displays all the components on the page Setting where and for whom the dashboard appears . By setting the dashboard availability and defaults, a user can specify on which pages and for which types of users the dashboard is seen. The following sections describe how to interact with configuration panel, save configured components to a dashboard, and administer a dashboard to be seen by either all or select users of an application. Accessing a Configuration Panel \u00b6 Each configurable component in the application is controlled by a configuration panel. All configuration panels share a similar layout and set of functions. Accessing the configuration panel differs by component, but most can be identified with the gear icon. Refer to the specific component\u2019s documentation for instructions on how to exactly access its configuration panel. Configuration is only available for those users with the appropriate permission. Primary Configuration Area \u00b6 The primary configuration area on a configuration page is typically a 2-panel card. For example, tables have a configuration area where the list of available fields are selectable on the left and the configurable values are displayed on the right. [Screenshot of table configuration panel with each side outlined and labeled] The primary configuration may vary slightly depending on the UI component. For example, in the search bar configuration, the configuration area is a list of the searchable fields with checkboxes. [Screenshot of search bar configuration] Versions \u00b6 A version is a saved configuration profile for an individual UI component. A user may use versions when experimenting with the configuration of a component before rolling it out to others. A version is specific to the user, in that no users can see another\u2019s user versions. Create A Version \u00b6 To create a version, use the Save To > Create Version button in the upper right of the configuration panel. Save A Version \u00b6 Once created, users can save their current component\u2019s configuration to the version by clicking Save To > Versions and selecting the version. Once saved, click Apply to apply the configuration to the component. [Save To Screenshot] Load A Version \u00b6 To retrieve a previously saved version, click the Load From button in the upper left of the configuration panel and select the desired version. This will load that version\u2019s configuration into the panel. Click Apply to the apply that version\u2019s configuration to the component. [Load From Screenshot] Delete A Version \u00b6 To delete a version, click the three dots icon next to Save To > Delete Versions , and select the version to delete. Confirm the deletion in the prompt. Configuring a Page \u00b6 The high-level steps to configuring a page are: Pick the role and page : If the configured page is applicable to a specific role, assume the role using the role selector. Then, navigate to the page where the configuration should apply. Configure each component on the page : Refer to the UI component documentation as necessary Save the configured state to a dashboard : The dashboard can either be an existing or new dashboard. If new, specify where and to which users the dashboard can be shown as a selection option. Set the priority of the dashboards by setting defaults : once the dashboard is saved, determine when it should be shown to a user in relative priority to other dashboards already configured for the page Pick the Role and Page \u00b6 It\u2019s common for an application to present data on the same page differently to users with different roles. For example, a field engineer may want to see the battery level and firmeware version of a device, while a customer service rep may want to see its last known location. If the configuration is applicable to a specific role, assume the role by selecting it from the role selector. Access the role selector by clicking the username in upper right of the page and selecting the role under User Role . [Screenshot of role selector] Navigate to the page to where the configuration should be applied. For example, if the configuration is intended for the Assets page, navigate to the Assets page. If the configuration is meant to be applied to an existing dashboard, load the dashboard by selecting it from the dashboard selector at the top of the page. [Screenshot of the dashboard selector] Configure Each Component on the Page \u00b6 Use the layout controller to place the desired components on the page. Refer to the documentation for the layout controller for more details. For each component, access the control panel and make the desired configuration changes. Click Apply in the configuration panel of that component once all the desired changes are performed. Refer to the document for the specific component for more details. Save the Configured State to a Dashboard \u00b6 Once all configuration to all components have been completed, a user can save the entire state of the page to a dashboard. To save the configured state to the current dashboard, click the check mark icon next to the dashboard selector. To revert the changes back to its previously saved state, click the reverse circle icon. [Screenshot of save & revert of current dashboard] Note: Default Dashboard Note: The Default dashboard is a user\u2019s personal dashboard configuration for exact page location. Saving the configuration to the dashboard titled \u201cDefault\u201d will only apply the configuration as the default dashboard to the current user, for currently assumed role, and to exact path for which the configuration was performed. For example, if a user A is on the Company > Assets page as Role A and saves a new configuration to the Default dashboard at that page, it will affect only the Default dashboard for User A while they are using Role A on the Company > Assets page. It will not impact the Default dashboard for user B at Company > Assets using Role A, not impact Default dashboard for any users at Company > Assets using Role B, and not impact the Default dashboard of user A at other Asset paths (e.g. Location > Assets) using Role A. To save the configured state to a new dashboard, click the three-dot icon next to the dashboard selector and click Save Dashboard As\u2026 In the Save Dashboard As\u2026 popup, enter the name of the new dashboard Select the availability of the dashboard from the Available To dropdown: Role Level - Any on this page: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any users of role X on this exact page path, with role X being the currently assumed role of the user doing the configuration. For example, only show this dashboard for users with Role A and on the Assets page at the Company > Assets path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cRole\u201d section of the dashboard selector. Page Level - Any user on this page: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any user of any role on this exact page path. For example, show this dashboard for all users on the Assets page at the Company > Assets path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cPage\u201d section. Blueprint Level - Any user on the page showing this page's Blueprint type: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any user of any role on a page of the same Blueprint type as the one being configured. For example, show this dashboard for all users on all Asset pages, regardless of its specific path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the section named after the Blueprint type (e.g. Assets). Personal Blueprint Level - Me on any page showing this page's Blueprint type: The option to select this dashboard will appear for only the current user on any page of any role on a page of the same Blueprint type as the one being configured. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cMine\u201d section. [Available To Screenshot] Saving to Current User & Page Only Looking for an option to save the configured page to the current user for the current role and current path? Save the dashboard to the Default dashboard by click the check mark next to the left of the dashboard selector. Set the Defaults Of The Page \u00b6 The previous section on Saving the Dashboard produces a dashboard that is available for selection by a user on a give page. It does not yet specify whether it will load by default when a user visits that page. In order to apply the dashboard to pages so that it loads for given users, page locations, and roles, set the dashboard defaults. Click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector to load the list of editable dashboards Depending on how many dashboards you have configured and their availability on the page, you will see dashboards separated into the following categories based on availability criteria: Role - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the user\u2019s role Page - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the user\u2019s page path in the application [Name of Blueprint Type] (e.g. Assets) - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the type of blueprint that page is showing Mine - Personal dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the type of blueprint that page is showing To set a dashboard to show by default on the page when it meets the availability criteria, select the dashboard > Use as Default . Only one dashboard from each section can be set as default (e.g. only one Role-level dashboard can be set as default, one Page-level dashboard can be set as default, etc.) In the event that multiple dashboards across each section is set as default, the application shows the default dashboard based on this ranking (from highest to lowest): Mine Role Page Blueprint Default Managing Dashboards \u00b6 Renaming A Dashboard \u00b6 To rename a dashboard, click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector and select the [dashboard name] > Rename . Delete a Dashboard \u00b6 To delete a dashboard, click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector and select the dashboard name > Delete . If the deleted dashboard was displayed on the page, the page will switch to showing the Default dashboard. Reset Personal Default Dashboard Back to Stock \u00b6 If the Default dashboard has been changed and a user wishes to reset it back to its original state (e.g. \u201cfactory defaults\u201d), select the Default dashboard from the dashboard selector. Then click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector > Reset to Default Dashboard .

Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and click Edit Layout . The dashboard will become editable by surfacing a series of buttons to add, remove, and update cards. [Screenshot: location of Edit Layout button to edit the dashboard] [Screeneshot: view of dashboard configuration mode] Configuring the Dashboard Viewer \u00b6 Configuring the Dashboard Page Layout \u00b6 While it is common for the dashboard to take up the entire page, users can display the dashboard viewer alongside one or more other UI components. For example, users configure the dashboard on the left and the map on the right. Set the layout of the dashboard with other components by clicking the layout controller icon in the upper right of the page. Grid Options \u00b6 A grid is a dashboard element designed to hold and organize other dashboard cards. Without grids, cards added To access grid options, click the gear icon next to the Dashboard title. Users can also access grid options for individual grids by clicking the gear icon next to the Grid title. Columns : To set the number of columns of cards on the dashboard, change the Columns field Column Width : To set the width of each column, change the Column With field. Widths can be specified in units such as px or fr. Row Gap : To set the gap size between rows of cards at the given grid level, change the Row Gap field Column Gap : To set the gap size between rows of cards at the given grid level, change the Column Gap field Card Options \u00b6 To access card options, click the gear icon next to the Grid title. The dialog that appears will contain both the Card Options and Grid Options.

To have no icon, use the value \u201cno\u201d Show Title : To show/hide the title, toggle the checkbox Size : To set the width and height of the card, change the W and H fields Style : To set the style of the card, select the style from the dropdown Grid Section : Adds a border radius only at the bottom edge of the card. The intended use is as the \u201cbottom half\u201d of a card, with a secondary card located above it to look like a single card. A common configuration of this card is to turn off the header and set the parent\u2019s grid row gap to 0. Transparent Secondary - Adds a border radius only at the top edge of the card. The intended use is as the \u201ctop half\u201d of a card, with a section card underneath to display more detailed data Tertiary - Adds extra padding around the card to give the appearance of supporting information Height : To set the height of the card, change the value in the Height field Adding a Card Type \u00b6 To add a card type, select the + sign next to the title of the grid. Available card types are Grid , Data Card , History Card , and Map Card . [Screenshot of navigation to adding a card to a dashboard or grid within a dashboard] Configuring the Grid \u00b6 Use a grid element to organize cards and create sections to display cards. Users can add one or more grids to the dashboard to hold a combination of data, history, and map cards. Users can also add grids within other grids for further organization. Grids for independent columns One advantage to using grids is to make data cards in each column more independent. Even though a dashboard may have multiple columns and will automatically fill cards into those columns, having a dedicated grid in a column will allow the cards to fill down each column. Without grids, cards in adjacent columns will get set to the same card height. To take advantage of this \u2018independent fill down\u2019 behavior, make sure to set the Size of the grid to have a W = 1. By default the grid has a Size with W = 2. For grid and card configuration options, refer to the sections on Grid Options and Card Options . Configuring the Data Card \u00b6 A data card is used to display data on assets, devices, and related blueprints in a card format. To access the data card configuration, click the gear icon in the bottom right of the card. The data card configuration follows the same configuration as a List Viewer . Refer to the List Viewer configuration for details. Configuring the History Card \u00b6 The history card shows the historical data on the selected asset/device on the dashboard. The history card behaves like a Responsive History Table with the card showing as a History Table view above a certain dimension threshold and as a History List Viewer below the threshold. The history card configuration follows the same configuration as the Responsive History Table , so refer to the configuration for the History Table Viewer and a History List Viewer for details. Configuring the Map Card \u00b6 The map card uses icons to show objects on the map in the dashboard view. To access the map card configuration, click the gear icon in the bottom right of the card. The map card configuration follows the same configuration as a Map Viewer . Refer to the Map configuration for details. Dashboard Configuration Best Practices If using a map card on mobile, consider using a map layout component to take up an entire section (configured using a layout controller) instead of using a map card in the dashboard. Using a map card on the mobile view may generate more whitespace/margins on mobile than desired, which detracts from the total viewable area of the map.","title":"Dashboard Viewer"},{"location":"config/dashboard-viewer/#dashboard-viewer","text":"The dashboard viewer is a component that displays details of assets, devices, or objects and its associated blueprints in a multi-card dashboard.

You can see an example of this below, where the table is showing the parent location of the asset. In this guide, we'll show you how to set that up in your interface. Parent table column example To add and configure parent columns in the child blueprint's table, you can add metadata to the parent attribute on the child blueprint. Edit metadata of parent attribute For the setter metadata, there are two values you need to understand, path and sourcePath . Setter Value Description path The path of the current blueprint you are trying to configure the parent column for. Paths determine where you are in the UI looking at this blueprint. sourcePath The path of the parent you are trying to load into the chid table. For example, if your root is Location which has a one to many relationship with Assets and you are on the assets page in a given location, your path would be location.assets and your source path would be location . Whether you use singular or plural depends on the type of relationship. If it was a one-to-one relationship, your path would look like location.asset . Alternatively, if your root was company and company had a one-to-many relationship with locations while locations still had a one-to-many relationship with assets, your path and sourcePath would be company.locations.assets & company.locations respectively. For our final example, lets say both your location blueprint and asset blueprint are roots and you want to load the location column into the root-level asset page. In this case your path is asset and your source path is location . Both will be singular since they are roots. Metadata Example { \"setter\" : { \"parentSources\" : [ { \"path\" : \"location.assets\" , \"sourcePath\" : \"location\" }, { \"path\" : \"company.locations.assets\" , \"sourcePath\" : \"company.locations\" }, { \"path\" : \"asset\" , \"sourcePath\" : \"location\" } ] } } Copying Parent Attributes onto the Child \u00b6 Along with enabling the parent to show up in the child table, you can also copy attributes from the parent onto the child. Note that this only gets updated when a relationship is created. If the attribute is changed on the parent later, the copied value on the child does not update . Setter Value Description child Child represents the attribute on the child blueprint you want to copy the value to. The format should follow blueprint.attribute .

Examples of components include tables, maps, rollover cards, and graphs. Configuring a page of the application relies on three primary steps: Configuring each component using its configuration panel . A configuration panel is a popup or screen where a user can configure and change settings of an individual component on a page Saving the components to a dashboard . A dashboard is a single view that arranges and displays all the components on the page Setting where and for whom the dashboard appears . By setting the dashboard availability and defaults, a user can specify on which pages and for which types of users the dashboard is seen. The following sections describe how to interact with configuration panel, save configured components to a dashboard, and administer a dashboard to be seen by either all or select users of an application. Accessing a Configuration Panel \u00b6 Each configurable component in the application is controlled by a configuration panel. All configuration panels share a similar layout and set of functions. Accessing the configuration panel differs by component, but most can be identified with the gear icon. Refer to the specific component\u2019s documentation for instructions on how to exactly access its configuration panel. Configuration is only available for those users with the appropriate permission. Primary Configuration Area \u00b6 The primary configuration area on a configuration page is typically a 2-panel card. For example, tables have a configuration area where the list of available fields are selectable on the left and the configurable values are displayed on the right. [Screenshot of table configuration panel with each side outlined and labeled] The primary configuration may vary slightly depending on the UI component. For example, in the search bar configuration, the configuration area is a list of the searchable fields with checkboxes. [Screenshot of search bar configuration] Versions \u00b6 A version is a saved configuration profile for an individual UI component. A user may use versions when experimenting with the configuration of a component before rolling it out to others. A version is specific to the user, in that no users can see another\u2019s user versions. Create A Version \u00b6 To create a version, use the Save To > Create Version button in the upper right of the configuration panel. Save A Version \u00b6 Once created, users can save their current component\u2019s configuration to the version by clicking Save To > Versions and selecting the version. Once saved, click Apply to apply the configuration to the component. Load A Version \u00b6 To retrieve a previously saved version, click the Load From button in the upper left of the configuration panel and select the desired version. This will load that version\u2019s configuration into the panel. Click Apply to the apply that version\u2019s configuration to the component. [Save To Screenshot] [Load From Screenshot] Delete A Version \u00b6 To delete a version, click the three dots icon next to Save To > Delete Versions , and select the version to delete. Confirm the deletion in the prompt. Configuring a Page \u00b6 The high-level steps to configuring a page are: Pick the role and page : If the configured page is applicable to a specific role, assume the role using the role selector. Then, navigate to the page where the configuration should apply. Configure each component on the page : Refer to the UI component documentation as necessary Save the configured state to a dashboard : The dashboard can either be an existing or new dashboard. If new, specify where and to which users the dashboard can be shown as a selection option. Set the priority of the dashboards by setting defaults : once the dashboard is saved, determine when it should be shown to a user in relative priority to other dashboards already configured for the page Pick the Role and Page \u00b6 It\u2019s common for an application to present data on the same page differently to users with different roles. For example, a field engineer may want to see the battery level and firmeware version of a device, while a customer service rep may want to see its last known location. If the configuration is applicable to a specific role, assume the role by selecting it from the role selector. Access the role selector by clicking the username in upper right of the page and selecting the role under User Role . [Screenshot of role selector] Navigate to the page to where the configuration should be applied. For example, if the configuration is intended for the Assets page, navigate to the Assets page. If the configuration is meant to be applied to an existing dashboard, load the dashboard by selecting it from the dashboard selector at the top of the page. [Screenshot of the dashboard selector] Configure Each Component on the Page \u00b6 Use the layout controller to place the desired components on the page. Refer to the documentation for the layout controller for more details. [Screenshot of layout controller on the UI] For each component, access the control panel and make the desired configuration changes. Click Apply in the configuration panel of that component once all the desired changes are performed. Refer to the document for the specific component for more details. Save the Configured State to a Dashboard \u00b6 Once all configuration to all components have been completed, a user can save the entire state of the page to a dashboard. To save the configured state to the current dashboard, click the check mark icon next to the dashboard selector. To revert the changes back to its previously saved state, click the reverse circle icon. [Screenshot of save & revert of current dashboard] Note: The Default dashboard is a user\u2019s personal dashboard configuration for exact page location. Saving the configuration to the dashboard titled \u201cDefault\u201d will only apply the configuration as the default dashboard to the current user, for currently assumed role, and to exact path for which the configuration was performed. For example, if a user A is on the Company > Assets page as Role A and saves a new configuration to the Default dashboard at that page, it will affect only the Default dashboard for User A while they are using Role A on the Company > Assets page. It will not impact the Default dashboard for user B at Company > Assets using Role A, not impact Default dashboard for any users at Company > Assets using Role B, and not impact the Default dashboard of user A at other Asset paths (e.g. Location > Assets) using Role A. To save the configured state to a new dashboard, click the three-dot icon next to the dashboard selector and click Save Dashboard As\u2026 In the Save Dashboard As\u2026 popup, enter the name of the new dashboard Select the availability of the dashboard from the Available To dropdown: Role Level - Any on this page: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any users of role X on this exact page path, with role X being the currently assumed role of the user doing the configuration. For example, only show this dashboard for users with Role A and on the Assets page at the Company > Assets path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cRole\u201d section of the dashboard selector. Page Level - Any user on this page: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any user of any role on this exact page path. For example, show this dashboard for all users on the Assets page at the Company > Assets path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cPage\u201d section. Blueprint Level - Any user on the page showing this page's Blueprint type: The option to select this dashboard will appear for any user of any role on a page of the same Blueprint type as the one being configured. For example, show this dashboard for all users on all Asset pages, regardless of its specific path. This will create an option in the dropdown under the section named after the Blueprint type (e.g. Assets). Personal Blueprint Level - Me on any page showing this page's Blueprint type: The option to select this dashboard will appear for only the current user on any page of any role on a page of the same Blueprint type as the one being configured. This will create an option in the dropdown under the \u201cMine\u201d section. Looking for an option to save the configured page to the current user for the current role and current path? Save the dashboard to the Default dashboard by click the check mark next to the left of the dashboard selector? Set the Defaults Of The Page \u00b6 The previous section on Saving the Dashboard produces a dashboard that is available for selection by a user on a give page. It does not yet specify whether it will load by default when a user visits that page. In order to apply the dashboard to pages so that it loads for given users, page locations, and roles, set the dashboard defaults. Click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector to load the list of editable dashboards Depending on how many dashboards you have configured and their availability on the page, you will see dashboards separated into the following categories based on availability criteria: Role - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the user\u2019s role Page - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the user\u2019s page path in the application [Name of Blueprint Type] (e.g. Assets) - Dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the type of blueprint that page is showing Mine - Personal dashboards that are available to show on this page based on the type of blueprint that page is showing To set a dashboard to show by default on the page when it meets the availability criteria, select the dashboard > Use as Default . Only one dashboard from each section can be set as default (e.g. only one Role-level dashboard can be set as default, one Page-level dashboard can be set as default, etc.) In the event that multiple dashboards across each section is set as default, the application shows the default dashboard based on this ranking (from highest to lowest): Mine Role Page Blueprint Default Managing Dashboards \u00b6 Renaming A Dashboard \u00b6 To rename a dashboard, click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector and select the [dashboard name] > Rename . Delete a Dashboard \u00b6 To delete a dashboard, click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector and select the dashboard name > Delete . If the deleted dashboard was displayed on the page, the page will switch to showing the Default dashboard. Reset Personal Default Dashboard Back to Stock \u00b6 If the Default dashboard has been changed and a user wishes to reset it back to its original state (e.g. \u201cfactory defaults\u201d), select the Default dashboard from the dashboard selector. Then click the three dots icon next to the dashboard selector > Reset to Default Dashboard .

UI Builder is aimed at designers and other non-technical users to be able to make UI style changes quickly. By making UI style changes through UI Builder, users do not need to know how to code, manipulate HTML/CSS, or redeploy a project. Designers can make styling changes independently of engineers building out the application. This reduces the need to ask engineers to make styling changes and shortens the communication loop. Active Themes Active themes should only be used on dev environments. In your staging and production environments, engineers will export the theme during the deployment so that it is \"static\". This ensures that designers do not accidentally turn an entire production interface pink, for example. Navigating the UI Builder \u00b6 Every project has it's own UI builder project associated with it. If a given project has multiple UIs, a single UI builder project can be used for multiple UIs or each UI can use a unique UI builder project. UI Builder projects are organized by the type of UI element you are editing. You can find the categories down the left side of the project. UI Builder Project When a user clicks into a specific UI element, they can visually see an example of the UI element and can manually update nearly every aspect of it (e.g. color, padding, borders, hover states etc.). Any changes they make to the element are live changes to the development UI. UI Builder Element Editor Variants \u00b6 Each UI type has variations of that element called variants. A variant is a way to reuse the style of a given element in multiple places. For example, if a designer wants to use the same style button on two different places in the UI, they would use the same variant and any changes made to that variant on UI Builder will update both of those buttons. This means that all the designer has to do is specify to the engineer that a given button should inherit a given variant. It also means the engineer can code/place the button and the designer can then use the UI builder to fine tune how it looks. For some components, the variant can be specified in configuration panel of the UI component itself rather than needing to communicate it to the engineer. Creating a New Variant \u00b6 Create a variant by clicking the type of UI element in the left navigation. Then scroll to the bottom of the page and enter in the name of the variant in Variant field and press the + button. Configure the variant in the resulting right hand panel. Adding a new variant Variant Inheritance \u00b6 When creating a new variant, you very rarely need to start from scratch. Let's say you already built your primary button, but now you just need an icon version. Instead of rebuilding all of your styles, you can set your new primaryIconic button to inherit all of the default values from the primary button. Once you set that up, you can add in any overrides you need, maybe the width or border-radius for example.

It is a way of transfering settings and workflows, and defining behaviors in plain JSON. Characteristics \u00b6 A model has several characteristics that should be enforced while using them. Following these characteristics make it easy to save them, restore them, edit them, and find handlers/executors for them. Plain JSON Object \u00b6 Models should be a simple javascript object. They should not be or contain classes, functions, or Dates anywhere in their structure. This allows them to be easy stored to a network server, or added to a Redux like mechanism. Immutable \u00b6 Models should be considered immutable. Changing a field redirectly in a Model will break caches, Redux and UI's that rely on top level object differences. Typed \u00b6 Models should have a type field that defines its unique identity. Normally this is a namespaced string such as myProject.MyModel Working with Models \u00b6 There tends to be a lot of broilerplate code when it comes to mutating models. To support this, the @leverege/model-util library is available for use. For example, when changing a value and following the immutablitly rule above, it would look like: import MyModel from './MyModel' // If model was defined as model = { type : 'myMode' , value : 5 , subValues : { sv : 1 } } // WRONG - Dont do this model . value = 42 // CORRECT - Do this const nModel = MyModel . setValue ( model , 42 ) model === nModel // => false model . subValues === nModel . subValues // => true The @leverege/model-util will support creating getters and setters for single values in the model, for child arrays of items, and for child maps of other values. By leveraging the ModelUtil class these can be created very easily. Once created, these Model should be registered with Plugins by invoking Plugins.add( 'Model', MyModel ) . Because Models have types, they are easily used with the Plugin's Factory mechanism. Setting up a mechanism that should change behaviors based on the type of model installed is just another plugin point. Mechanisms like if/then/else logic options, color or symbol selectors, filtering or exporting of data become new plugin point Factories with the Plugins bound against the Model type. If you need to allow the user to edit a model, going to the ModelEditorFactory to find a React component works great. Using the immutablily principle, the Model object and UI Element's eventData mechanism, change a model via a UI Element and sending the new model value to a change listener is very easy.

This library supplies a central registration mechanism in which various classes, functions, and objects can be declared to participate in other framework's interfaces. Often this binding can occur without the need for a direct dependency on target framework. The uses for this 'repository of things' can very greatly: from dynamic url routing, to custom contextual actions, to attribute definition, to logic intercept mechanisms, to initializers, to UI editor lookups, to colorizers, to name just a few. Use \u00b6 The use of this library can be very simple and the requirements are very few: Including the library in your own code Defining an interface for your custom plugin mechanism (sometimes called Plugin Points) Picking a unique plugin name for your mechanism (usually namespaced, like . ) import { Plugins } from '@leverege/plugin' // 1 const plgs = Plugins . get ( 'myProject.Initializer' ) // 2 plgs . forEach ( ( initializer ) => { initializer . init () // 3 } ) In this example, we have defined our own custom plugin point that will invoke an init method at the appropriate time. It has imported the library (1), asked for all plugins registered as a myProject.Initializer plugin (2), and used the custom plugin point's interface to invoke init() on each plugin (3). It can be that simple to define your own custom Plugins point. To participate in that example plugin point, simply add a plugin to the Plugin mechanism: import { Plugins } from '@leverege/plugin' // 1 MyInitializer = { init : () => { /* do something */ } } // Alternately: molten.addPlugin( 'myProject.Initializer', MyInitializer ) Plugins . add ( 'myProject.Initializer' , MyInitializer ) This Plugins.add() or molten.addPlugin() registers the plugin for use at the specified plugins point. Adding a plugin can be as simple as this. Some plugin points are a little more complicated. These plugin points will often use match objects , type values, and methods to help determine whether or not a particular plugin should be used in a particular instance. Some will define sort values (like Molten's initializer plugins ) to help aid in ordered invokation. Some are meant to be used in Factory lookup mechanism or participate in active Views . These extra mechanisms need to be defined by the plugin points interface documentation so developers can understand how to leverage the particular plugin point. Observable \u00b6 The Plugins mechanism is also observable, meaning that listeners can be registered to detect when plugins are added or removed. This can help plugin endpoints respond to new plugins or avoid ordering issues cause by importation/registration order. It can also help to support dynamic loading of code. // Add a listener to all types const unsubscribeGlobal = Plugins . on ( listener ) // Add a listener to a specific type const unsubscribeType = Plugins . on ( 'myProject.Initializer' , listener ) // To remove a listener from all types Plugins . off ( listener ) // or use the returned function unsubscribeGlobal () // To remove a listener from a specific type Plugins . off ( 'myProject.Initializer' , listener ) // or use the returned function unsubscribeType () The listener method will be invoked with an object when an add or remove occurs: { type , // either 'pluginAdded' or 'pluginRemoved', pluginType , // The plugin type that changed plugin , // The plugin that was added or removed plugins // The Plugins object } An alternative why of determining if Plugins were added or removed without listening to Plugins is to look at the version number for a type. const version = Plugins . getVersion ( 'myProject.Initializer' ) Anytime a plugin is added or removed, the version number will be updated. This change detection is useful when caches are being used to record previous work using the plugins. A change to the version can be used to bust the cache and cause the work to be recalculated with the current plugin set. const version = Plugins . getVersion ( 'myProject.PluginPoint' ) // React Example const result = useMemo ( ( ) => { const p = Plugins . get ( 'myProject.PluginPoint' ) // do some work return result }, [ version ] ) // @leverege/value-cache example const result = valueCache . calc (( ) => { const p = Plugins . get ( 'myProject.PluginPoint' ) // do some work return result }, version )","title":"Plugins"},{"location":"setup/nav/#plugins","text":"Molten makes heavy use of the @leverege/plugins library.

Hierarchy diagram Let's break down the relationships in the example above. The company blueprint has 3 child relationships, all of which are one-to-many. The child blueprints are: Location Blueprint Asset Blueprint Tracker Blueprint The location blueprint also has child relationships, all of which are one-to-many. These child blueprints are: Asset Blueprint Tracker Blueprint Zone Blueprint Beacon Blueprint Floor Blueprint For a refresher on relationship types and usages, { please refer to this link. } Selecting Roots \u00b6 You can have one root or multiple roots in your UI. In this case, it makes sense for the company blueprint to be a root, which will make the company blueprint a top level navigation option. Company root example On top of adding companies to the top level navigation, the root also will only load that blueprint and it's children. For example, if you selected the location blueprint as a root along with the company blueprint, you would see both in the top nav (example below). Multi-root example Under the location's tab, you will have entirely new set of pages, representing the child blueprints, in your UI. This pages will be completely separate from the pages representing the same blueprint under the company root. To help visual this, take a look at the diagram below. Multi-root hierarchy Root Groups \u00b6 In some cases, it's helpful to see your assets or trackers across all companies or locations at the root level. In these types of cases, we find it helpful to group those pages together. The grouping mechanism puts a group of root pages into a dropdown in the top navigation, saving you critical screen space. Group dropdown example These pages will load individually, so you will have one page for a system-wide list of assets and one for a system-wide list of trackers. Configuring Roots \u00b6 To make a blueprint a root, all you have to do is add the tag is:root to the blueprint tag section. Group dropdown example Below are the different types of configuration options for roots via tags. Property Purpose is:root Adds the blueprint to the top-level navigation as a root rootNavGroup:<Name> If a blueprint is set as a root, it can be added to a group in the top navigation. Name represents which group the blueprint is added to and is used in the label of the dropdown rootNavGroupIcons:<URL> To set the icon for a group, use this tag on any blueprint in that group. This icon must be hosted publicly online Hiding Roots from Specific Roles \u00b6 Not every role should have the same access, and the same goes for roots. You can easily hide a root from a given role by using the tag excludeFrom:<Role> Property Purpose excludeFrom:<Role> Hides this root from a given role excludeFrom:* Hides this root from all roles.

By making a blueprint a root, you are selecting that blueprint to be the root of your hierarchy for that section of the UI. The root page will load a system-wide list of every item of that blueprint type. Let's take the hierarchy below as our example. Hierarchy diagram Let's break down the relationships in the example above. The company blueprint has 3 child relationships, all of which are one-to-many. The child blueprints are: Location Blueprint Asset Blueprint Tracker Blueprint The location blueprint also has child relationships, all of which are one-to-many.
